# Custom Element Library for Schemdraw

A simple library of components I am using to create schematics with the **schemdraw**.

The only dependency for this library is the schemdraw.
To install the library with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install "git+https://github.com/lokgar/sdcomms.git"
```

For more details about the schemdraw, refer to its [documentation](https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
